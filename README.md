# track-bulk-email-status
Widely used in email marketing, I just want to send bulk emails with certain template, and would like to see how many people have seen it.

## Workaround
 - Upload list of emails, in CSV format (up to 50,000 emails)
 - Upload HTML of email template
 - Once started, it records open status of every sent mail, and information of total opened count is regularly updated.
 
## How this works
  Tracking email is important in Email marketing.
  In this project, image attaching technology is used.
  It is the most efficient and fastest way of tracking emails, but on the other hand, it has some downsides.
  
     Downsides
      - Some email clients don't support image displaying because of security issues, so in that situation, image load is not requested, and this may result some unwanted moments.
      - Mostly, sending bulk emails can be considered as spam activity, so we need to adapt a measure to by pass this issue.
